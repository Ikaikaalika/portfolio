## Work Experience

**Data Scientist/Artificial Intelligence Engineer**

**University of Utah - Salt Lake City, UT August 2019 to Present**

-	Artificial Intelligence team lead for medical diagnoses with UCSF. (Data for this project is similar to image data)
-	Developed Data pipeline from with SQL, Red Cap API, to pandas from data collected in Uganda.
-	Developed Support Vector Machine and CNN to predict patient diagnosis from breath sample.
-	Developed GC-MS analytical artificial intelligence algorithm and new way to analyze and classify electro-chemical breath data. Paper currently in works on this.
-	Created multiple GANâ€™s to synthesize multiple types of patient data to overcome data deficit common in the medical industry. 
-	Developed MLOps/AI pipeline to continuously improve models with additional data.
-	Deployed ML classification model to Linux Ubuntu based nVidia Jetson edge-computing system for rapid diagnosis (command & UI based system)

**Data Scientist/Artificial Intelligence -Intern**

**Micron Technology - Boise, ID May 2022 to August 2022**

-	Developed custom data visualization software in python with Django and TKinter to quickly trouble shoot manufacturing errors.
-	Assisted in creation of semiconductor tool stats dashboard with Django to identify out of spec tooling
-	Assisted in creation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (deep learning) pipeline and model to predict metrology stats to reduce manufacturing decision time by 50% or more reducing development times greatly.
-	Created data pipelines for the aforementioned projects using SQL (Oracle & MS systems).
-	Displayed and communicated data reports with Tableau dashboards.

**Process Engineer - Intern**

**Marathon Petroleum - Salt Lake City, UT August 2021 to November 2021**

-	Facilitated and developed test run on FCU Naphtha Splitter to decrease olefin obstruction in Gasoline Hydrotreater resulting in the increase of revenue of $100k+ in 6 months.
-	Developed created secondary alarms for Crude LOPA Recommendation using heat exchanger energy balance
-	Developed plan to replace water line meter, supervised and developed pressure surveys and a CFD model
-	Troubleshooted various issues for projects such as tank farm audits, PI page production, and catalyst deactivation
